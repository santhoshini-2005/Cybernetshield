DETECTION OF PHISHING WEBSITES USING AI
The system developed detects if a URL link is phishing or legitimate by using machine
learning models and deep neural network algorithms. The feature extraction and the models used
on the dataset helped to uniquely identify phishing URLs and also the performance accuracy of
the models used. It is also surprisingly accurate at detecting the genuineness of a URL link.
Phishing attacks are a rapidly expanding threat in the cyber world, costing internet users billions
of dollars each year. It involves the use of a variety of social engineering tactics to obtain sensitive
information from users. Hence, Phishing techniques can be detected using a variety of types of
communication, including email, instant chats, pop-up messages, and web pages. This project was
able to categorize and recognize how phishers carry out phishing attacks and the different ways in
which researchers have helped to solve phishing detection. Hence, the proposed system of this
project worked with different feature selection and machine learning and deep neural networks
such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, XGBooster, Multilayer Perceptions, Auto
Encoder Neural Network, and Random Forest to identify patterns in which URL links can be
detected easily. The Model with the highest accuracy based on the feature extraction algorithm used
to identify phishing URL from legitimate URL links was integrated to a web application where
users can input website URL links to detect if it is legitimate or phishing.
